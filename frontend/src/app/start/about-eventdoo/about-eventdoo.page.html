        <br>
        <h3>Sign up</h3>

        <p> <b>I tried to sign up but I can not click the button “Sign up”. What is wrong?</b></p>

        <p>          The email you use is already registered. So try to login or reset your password on the login page. Or make
        sure you wrote your email the correct way and try again. Otherwise you are asked to use a different email address.</p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>I signed up, but never got an email.       </b> </p>
        <p>          Please make sure to refresh your email as well as your spam. It sometimes takes up to 10 minutes for you to
        receive our email. If you haven’t received it till then, you can use the “send Mail again” button which is located
        on the Login page. Just type in your email and your password and hit the login button. A message will be displayed
        saying please check your emails and next to it there is a button saying “Send Mail again”. Click that button and enter
        your email address.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Login</h3>

        <p> <b>I forgot my password what should I do? </b> </p>
        <p>Just click on forgot password in order to get a email with a link to reset your password. It’s that easy.</p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>I get the failure “Please verify your email address”. Why is the login not working? </b> </p>
        <p>After you have signed yourself up, you need to verify by opening the link you get from us in the email in a new tab.
        You will then be told you can now login and proceed to login.</p>

        <h3>    Creating an event service</h3>
