# Biweekly report (23.10.2019)

###### General Issues:
We had some difficulties when it came to communicating between backend and frontend. Especially
when it comes to HTTP Client definitions. 

###### Backend:
I felt pretty lost in the beginning with a new environment language and framework


###### Frontend:
In frontend project, the first difficulty was to get used to the new technologies (Angular and Ionic).
