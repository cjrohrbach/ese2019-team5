Backend:
In the backend especially before Milestone 1 we had the problem, that the backend to frontend communication 
wasn’t working (as in not with the other group members but in the programm).
One of the mistakes we made was sending the wrong error to the front but also figuring out what data the
frontend actually needs wasn’t easy. Finally the test works as in fails but at least it is an assertion error.
I still think that communication within backend is working quite well.
Also before Milestone 1 ended I felt that communication was working quite well.
But as I feared as soon as a Milestone is over people tend to take it a little bit less serious and 
communication as well as coding slows down. (But that is my personal view, that was also communicated to
the rest of the team).



General: We are glad we did a small retroperspective in the last group meeting, realizing what should be improved. For example one of the group members likes to work on things that get done in the beginning so she is not that much involved right before the deadline. Also we agreed on Milestone 2 to be:

Implement	  -sendMailAgain
-	Forgot Password
-	Update Profile and Change Password
-	Create EventServices and display them as a list
