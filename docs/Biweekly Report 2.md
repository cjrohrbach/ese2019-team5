# Biweekly report (30.10.2019)

###### General Issues:
In the first week after the last biweekly report, we focused on the first milestone (authorization and authentication).
It was a huge effort but we managed to hand in a satisfying implementation in time and we are happy and proud about that.

One day after the deadline, we met to deliberate the past three weeks and to find solutions to problems and improvements in our working organization.
As there was not (and still is not) defined a second milestone, we discussed about how to continue and what to implement next. 
Also, we set goals for the next two weeks:
1) Complete Milestone 1:
    Adding compulsory information to the sign up form: address data
    Add a "service" for the user if he did not see the email asking him/her to verify his/her address.
    Add a "service" for the user if he/she forgot the password.
    
 2) Add a profile page for every user where he/she can add information (e.g.a picture, phone number etc.)
 
 3) Add a page where all services are listed / shown
 
 4) Add the possibility to provide / publish a service in the App and 
    create a page where all provided services are published.

###### Backend:
In the backend especially before Milestone 1 we had the problem, that the backend to frontend communication 
wasn�t working (as in not with the other group members but in the programm).
One of the mistakes we made was sending the wrong error to the front but also figuring out what data the
frontend actually needs wasn�t easy. Finally the test works as in fails but at least it is an assertion error.
I still think that communication within backend is working quite well.
Also before Milestone 1 ended I felt that communication was working quite well.
But as I feared as soon as a Milestone is over people tend to take it a little bit less serious and 
communication as well as coding slows down. (But that is my personal view, that was also communicated to
the rest of the team).



General: We are glad we did a small retroperspective in the last group meeting, realizing what should be improved. For example one of the group members likes to work on things that get done in the beginning so she is not that much involved right before the deadline. Also we agreed on Milestone 2 to be:

Implement	  -sendMailAgain
-	Forgot Password
-	Update Profile and Change Password
-	Create EventServices and display them as a list


###### Frontend:
We get along much better with the technologies and we are more efficient when searching for solutions for our problems.
It feels like we're developing some kind of "intuition" which makes it much more easier to code.
